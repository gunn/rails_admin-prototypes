= Rails Admin Mockups

This project contains mockups for the rails_admin[https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin] project. They are currently focussed on trying to figure out how best to integrate the {activo theme}[http://activo.dmfranc.com/] into it.

Currently this project consists of some mouckps in 'mockups', the source files in 'fireworks_pngs' and a site runnable by middleman[https://github.com/tdreyno/middleman].

Please fork and improve!

== In detail

1. Links to the sites root page and the dashboard
2. Links for the currently logged in user - prefernces and logout
3. Links to each of the models managed by rails_admin. These replaces our current tabs. Putting them here means we don't have to worry about them overflowing.
4. Tabs for Index, Show and Edit. When on a speific players view page in the example, the Index and Edit tabs would be active providing an easy way to jump to one of those.
5. History for the current model.

== A login page

== Nav links in sidebar
link:mockups/nav_in_sidebar.png

Alternative placement for the navigation links, frees up header some more. Possibly these could be removed altogther and be covered by the user icons in the top right.

== Error flash message
link:mockups/error.png

== Error inline
link:mockups/error_inline.png

Compact, but might be a mistake if we ever wanted to show more than one flash message at a time.

== Error above
link:mockups/error_above.png

== Dark header
link:mockups/dark_header.png

Alternative style.

== Dark with high_buttons

== Dark with darkened buttons

Lot's of thanks to David Francisco for the theme, and everyone who's contributed to the web-app-theme, and rails_admin projects.
